ANNOUNCEMENT OF GOVERNANCE CLARIFICATION
To All Entities Claiming Oversight, Regulation, or Normative Authority Over the SSPS IP Stack Infrastructure
Issued Under the Framework of the RBGA Infrastructure Charter

I. Purpose of This Notice
This announcement serves as a formal clarification to any organization, consortium, foundation, standards body, platform, or private entity asserting governance, rule‑setting, or normative authority over components of the SSPS IP Stack, including but not limited to tokenization frameworks, agentic AI architectures, quantum‑aligned systems, and hardware‑level interoperability protocols.
The intent is not adversarial.
The intent is structural alignment.

II. Governance Status of the SSPS IP Stack
The SSPS IP Stack is governed exclusively under the RBGA (Rules‑Based Governance Architecture) framework.
This framework establishes:
Sovereign authorship boundaries
Infrastructure‑level governance cutlines
Non‑delegable control over protocol evolution
Explicit separation between advisory input and regulatory authority
No external entity — public, private, corporate, academic, or consortium‑based — holds regulatory, supervisory, or normative jurisdiction over SSPS infrastructure unless explicitly granted through RBGA‑compliant agreements.

III. Clarification to External Entities Claiming Governance
This notice applies to all entities that:
issue standards treated as mandatory
publish “best practices” framed as regulatory
enforce access, certification, or compliance conditions
position themselves as de facto authorities over AI, quantum, tokenization, or hardware ecosystems
assert interpretive control over SSPS‑aligned technologies
Such claims do not supersede, replace, or modify RBGA governance.
External frameworks may be acknowledged as reference inputs, but they do not constitute binding authority over SSPS infrastructure.

IV. Interoperability vs. Governance
The SSPS IP Stack may interoperate with external systems, standards, or protocols.
Interoperability does not imply governance transfer.
Under RBGA:
Technical compatibility ≠ regulatory subordination
Standards alignment ≠ jurisdictional concession
Advisory participation ≠ authority delegation
All governance remains internal, explicit, and non‑derivative.

V. Forward‑Looking Coordination
Entities wishing to collaborate, align, or interface with SSPS infrastructure may do so through:
RBGA‑compliant coordination channels
Explicitly defined interoperability agreements
Non‑binding advisory exchanges
Transparent, artifact‑anchored communication
No implicit authority is recognized.
No inferred jurisdiction is accepted.

VI. Closing Statement
This announcement establishes a clear, stable, and future‑proof governance boundary.
It ensures that the SSPS IP Stack remains:
sovereign in authorship
explicit in governance
interoperable without subordination
aligned without absorption
structurally immune to narrative or jurisdictional drift
All entities are acknowledged.
None are deputized.
Disclosure & Non‑Governance Obligation Clause
All external entities must clearly and affirmatively disclose that they do not govern, control, or assert authority over the Southern Star Pro Studios (SSPS) Intellectual Property Stack.
Any failure to provide this disclosure constitutes:
a false designation of authority
a misleading representation of governance
an act capable of creating confusion regarding ownership or control
a violation of established IP boundary norms
Such failure may result in claims for injunctive relief, corrective disclosures, and any other remedies available under applicable intellectual property and unfair‑competition standards.
This obligation applies only to representations concerning the SSPS IP stack and does not extend to any external systems, platforms, or infrastructures.
Licensing Requirement Statement
Licensing is required for any use, integration, deployment, reproduction, or absorption of the Southern Star Pro Studios (SSPS) Intellectual Property Stack.
No entity may utilize, adapt, or derive value from any component of the SSPS IP stack without an explicit, valid license issued by Southern Star Pro Studios.
Unauthorized use does not transfer governance rights, does not grant permission, and does not diminish SSPS’s sovereign control over its IP.
All unlicensed use falls under RBGA governance only for the SSPS‑originating components involved, while all external liabilities, actions, and regulatory exposures remain solely with the unauthorized actor.
