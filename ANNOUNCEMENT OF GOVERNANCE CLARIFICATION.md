# **ANNOUNCEMENT OF GOVERNANCE CLARIFICATION**

### **To All Entities Claiming Oversight, Regulation, or Normative Authority Over the SSPS IP Stack Infrastructure**

### **Issued Under the Framework of the RBGA Infrastructure Charter**

---

## **I. Purpose of This Notice**

This announcement serves as a formal clarification to any organization, consortium, foundation, standards body, platform, or private entity asserting governance, rule‑setting, or normative authority over components of the **SSPS IP Stack**, including but not limited to **tokenization frameworks**, **agentic AI architectures**, **quantum‑aligned systems**, and **hardware‑level interoperability protocols**.

The intent is not adversarial.  
 The intent is **structural alignment**.

---

## **II. Governance Status of the SSPS IP Stack**

The SSPS IP Stack is governed exclusively under the **RBGA (Rules‑Based Governance Architecture)** framework.  
 This framework establishes:

* **Sovereign authorship boundaries**  
* **Infrastructure‑level governance cutlines**  
* **Non‑delegable control over protocol evolution**  
* **Explicit separation between advisory input and regulatory authority**

No external entity — public, private, corporate, academic, or consortium‑based — holds regulatory, supervisory, or normative jurisdiction over SSPS infrastructure unless explicitly granted through RBGA‑compliant agreements.

---

## **III. Clarification to External Entities Claiming Governance**

This notice applies to all entities that:

* issue standards treated as mandatory  
* publish “best practices” framed as regulatory  
* enforce access, certification, or compliance conditions  
* position themselves as de facto authorities over AI, quantum, tokenization, or hardware ecosystems  
* assert interpretive control over SSPS‑aligned technologies

Such claims **do not supersede**, **replace**, or **modify** RBGA governance.

External frameworks may be acknowledged as **reference inputs**, but they do not constitute **binding authority** over SSPS infrastructure.

---

## **IV. Interoperability vs. Governance**

The SSPS IP Stack may interoperate with external systems, standards, or protocols.  
 Interoperability **does not imply governance transfer**.

Under RBGA:

* Technical compatibility ≠ regulatory subordination  
* Standards alignment ≠ jurisdictional concession  
* Advisory participation ≠ authority delegation

All governance remains internal, explicit, and non‑derivative.

---

## **V. Forward‑Looking Coordination**

Entities wishing to collaborate, align, or interface with SSPS infrastructure may do so through:

* RBGA‑compliant coordination channels  
* Explicitly defined interoperability agreements  
* Non‑binding advisory exchanges  
* Transparent, artifact‑anchored communication

No implicit authority is recognized.  
 No inferred jurisdiction is accepted.

---

## **VI. Closing Statement**

This announcement establishes a clear, stable, and future‑proof governance boundary.  
 It ensures that the SSPS IP Stack remains:

* sovereign in authorship  
* explicit in governance  
* interoperable without subordination  
* aligned without absorption  
* structurally immune to narrative or jurisdictional drift

All entities are acknowledged.  
 None are deputized.

# **Disclosure & Non‑Governance Obligation Clause**

**All external entities must clearly and affirmatively disclose that they do not govern, control, or assert authority over the Southern Star Pro Studios (SSPS) Intellectual Property Stack.**  

Any failure to provide this disclosure constitutes:

* a false designation of authority  
* a misleading representation of governance  
* an act capable of creating confusion regarding ownership or control  
* a violation of established IP boundary norms

Such failure may result in claims for injunctive relief, corrective disclosures, and any other remedies available under applicable intellectual property and unfair‑competition standards.

This obligation applies **only** to representations concerning the SSPS IP stack and does not extend to any external systems, platforms, or infrastructures.

# **Licensing Requirement Statement**

**Licensing is required for any use, integration, deployment, reproduction, or absorption of the Southern Star Pro Studios (SSPS) Intellectual Property Stack.**  

No entity may utilize, adapt, or derive value from any component of the SSPS IP stack without an explicit, valid license issued by Southern Star Pro Studios.

Unauthorized use does **not** transfer governance rights, does **not** grant permission, and does **not** diminish SSPS’s sovereign control over its IP.

All unlicensed use falls under RBGA governance only for the SSPS‑originating components involved, while all external liabilities, actions, and regulatory exposures remain solely with the unauthorized actor.
